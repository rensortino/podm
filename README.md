This project provides a hands-on exploration of diffusion models, derived from first principles and grounded in the foundational concepts presented in the [arXiv book on diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXXX.XXXXXXX). The goal is to implement key ideas step-by-step, ensuring deep understanding through code.

## 📚 Overview

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have gained significant attention for their ability to generate high-quality samples across various domains (e.g., images, audio, and molecules). This project breaks down the mathematics and algorithms behind diffusion models into digestible components, with implementations in PyTorch.
